Not to snake but yourself.. Why snake bite me? Because my area has many snakes and i have not taken any precausion. Etc. Etc..,2025-08-29 14:32:20.974193096

@angeloflovenunlimit,"I think when we are bitten by the snake. Firstly, we ask ourselves what we can do to save ourselves, then we must do something immediately to save ourselves, take out the toxins and heal ourselves. But afterwards, for the long term, we must learn the lesson from it. We ask why this happened to me. Ah maybe we are unconscious that those areas are the place that many snakes live and we step on it. We can learn from the snakes , and ourselves and life then we change so that we prevent from being bitten and hurt next time.  Prevention is better than healing. Of course, making mistakes, being hurt is unavoidable, but what matter is we are more conscious and learn from it. It is good for our betterment and the right path of evolution. When we reap the fruits, we should know what the seeds we have sown before. We trace the causes and we learn and we can change sowing the seeds to prevent it from happening again in the future. Life has sent us the  valuable and meaningful lessons for us to learn what is right and better ourselves. It is the chance we learn from life , from real life school the valuable and necessary lessons we need for ourselves and our evolution. If we just focus on immediate fixing only , it just helps at the surface level , in short time and that is not enough . If we don't learn the roots, the seeds, and the causes  , we don't change, improve it, learn from it, we will  receive more dangerous and stronger situations that we must cope with to truly realise the lesson and graduate. When we learn , are conscious, change into the right course, those teaching the same lessons events and situations will disappear. Face it, deal with it, learn and grow from it 😊❤😊 thank you I love you",2025-05-05 14:32:27.407376051

Jo hai vo ab tu kr sakti hai jo tere hath mei hai. 23 will be over in July. 24th journey will start. Jo log kr rh hai krne dei vo kuch bhi achive kr rh hai why comparison.
Teri journey Teri hai. What you can do now build now. See preksha life mei jo hogya kuch nhi badlne vala. Blame krne sei kya fayda vo unka apna journey tha jo tere saath hua learning hua na. 
Life akele hei ladni padhti hai akle hei khara hona ortha hai. Sab log tho bas saath chalthe hai koi aaghe koi piche. 
Tu apni journey sudhar. Negativity dur la depend hona chor. 
Tera kya goal hai vo saari cheese achive krna dreams ghumna travel Krna. Nay logo sei milna. Or ha stories likhana. Logo kei madas Krna social work. Yh end goal hai. Yh sub kaisa hoga ca bankr. Achi job mnc corporate fir business farming. Paisa kamygi tabhi tho krgi.
Jo tera dard hai vo Tera strong point ban sakta hai soch. 
Kitne logo kei liye inspiring hoga agar haar nhi maanegi.",2025-05-05 14:32:29.348609924
