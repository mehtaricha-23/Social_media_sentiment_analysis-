"Oh honey just break up with him and be his close friend through his dad’s cancer. Be ready for him to potentially show his ass and act out on you bc you’re still kids & he might not have good emotional regulation at that age. He might also use the situation as a reason to really act out. But just tell him you don’t want to move forward with a relationship but you’ll be there for him. Everyone will definitely treat you badly like you are satan herself if he throws you under the bus, but you can’t build a false relationship over this. And that’s what you’d be doing if you stayed. Just be really nice and keep texting him so he sees you’re not going anywhere and of course you need to accept you can’t date anyone else right now or even hookup.",Fun-Dare-7864,2025-09-04 22:08:33

"So I have OCD and family death was one of my ruminations. My mom had me young but had her own issues and so my grandparents mostly raised me. I always worried about my mom and grandparents dying. I would leave my phone on at night just in case they called. I was convinced I was the only one that could save their lives if they called for some reason (yay OCD!). 

My grandmother died after I was her caretaker for 5 years. I was prepared for that one. Then a year later my mom died. It was very unexpected but not surprising due to her life choices. But one morning I woke up to a missed call from the county. I was confused and my first thought was that it was because my mom was in jail. The phone rang again and I picked up. It was the coroner telling me that my mom had died. Here I was, worrying about missing phone calls in the middle of the night that would lead to my mom’s death and I wake up to a phone call about my mom’s death. My worst fear.

And you know what? I couldn’t bring her back and I wouldn’t have been able to save her either. I just had to live through the experience.

My long comment was to bring up exposure and the importance of it and also the importance of living in the moment and knowing you can’t change anything. You worrying about it won’t change the outcome. They will either be there or they won’t. And thinking about it doesn’t do any good and takes away from your peace and happiness in the moment.

So many sleepless nights worrying about my mom dying and she did. And that’s what happened. And my life didn’t end. I experienced the natural pain of grief and I kept on going. I still have my grandpa, we care for him. And one day I’ll have to go through the grief again. But I can’t worry about it because I won’t enjoy the time I currently have with him.",photogenicmusic,2025-09-04 22:00:44

Yes seriously fuck what people think! My mantra,destroyingangel_777,2025-09-04 22:00:32
So basically our minds process the good memories better than say something like someone jumping out is and scaring us. It just sounds like a way for a minds to protect us from having to relive something like that. Thing is it’s sad to think some people can have something like that good flooding back from just a touch or seeing someone. I appreciate the response by the way and how detailed it is :),DEeD-NGone,2025-09-04 22:00:25
